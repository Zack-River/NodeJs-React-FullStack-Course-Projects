If you want the change to apply only inside Git Bash, modify your .bashrc file:

Open Git Bash and type:
nano ~/.bashrc

Add the following line at the end:

export PS1="\[\e[32m\]\u@\h \W$ \[\e[m\]"

This makes your prompt green.
Save the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).
Restart Git Bash inside VS Code.


You can also change the entire theme by modifying the "terminal.integrated.theme" setting in VS Code:
json:
"terminal.integrated.theme": "dark"
